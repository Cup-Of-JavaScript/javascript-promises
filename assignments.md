# JavaScript Promises Assignments

## Ex. 1 

Create an arrow function called `getUTCDateTime` that returns a Promise that contains the current UTC time.  The Promise only implements the `resolve` callback function and not the `reject` callback function.

Usage:
```
let theDate = await getUTCDateTime();
console.log(theDate);
```

Output
```
Mon, 06 Jun 2022 18:38:11 GMT
```

Note: This is an academic example and should not be use in production.
